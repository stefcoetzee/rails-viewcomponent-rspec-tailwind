# Rails ViewComponents with Tailwind CSS and RSpec

This is the companion repo for its namesake
[blog post](https://stefcoetzee.com/2022/02/18/rails-viewcomponent-rspec-tailwind).

Join in the fun by checking out the `start-here` branch and coding along as
you progress deeper into the guide.

## Getting Started

The `main` branch contains the app in its transformed state.
Whether you choose to use that or the pre-ViewComponent branch mentioned
above, the follow instructions will work the same either way.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Create the test and development databases
bin/rails db:create
# Seed the database with example data
bin/rails db:seed

# Start the development server
bin/dev
```
